# Python Discord Bot Template for SparkedHost

This is a template of Python, Markdown and text files that can be used when coding a Discord Bot using Python. I use a website called SparkedHost to host my Discord Bots; this template is compatible to be hosted via SparkedHost and *may* be compatible for other online hosting sites, too.

Please always click the green 'Use this template' drop-down button and create a new repository before making changes to this template.

## Please Remember:

- Edit the `.env` file with your super secret Discord Bot Token.
- Add/remove Python packages in the `requirements.txt` file as necessary.
- Add your code to `main.py`, and check up on `Helpful Information` -> `FAQs.py` if you get stuck and need to copy/paste frequently used code!
- Edit this `README.md` file to better reflect what your Discord Bot is about and to provide users with help on how to use it, as necessary. Have a look at `Helpful Information` -> `markdown-cheat-sheet.md` for ideas on how to present the info nicely!

Thank you for using my Discord Bot Template and let me know if you experience any issues.

### Happy Coding!
