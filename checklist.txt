Bot Code Management:
- Have variables (such as the channel ID, support staff roles, etc) that are set to each server the bot is in and can be set/changed using commands or buttons/drop-downs.
  (Folder names set as the guild server ID, and then text files in there that change based on the channel / role IDs that the admin sets)
- A separate page per command / button callback.

Bot Features:
- English, Spanish, Portuguese & Arabic Languages
- Ability to enable/disable languages (both by hiding the buttons completely or disabling the button)
- Separate commands for multi-language or just English with categories?
